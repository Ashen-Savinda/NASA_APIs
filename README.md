I have used the APOD API and the Mars Rover Photos API in this application. This application uses the Tailwind CSS framework for styling and is responsive and compatible with various devices and screen sizes.When first visiting the web application, the user is welcomed with the Astronomy Picture of the Day in the home page. To view the Mars Rover images, the user has to either signup or log in. The user can use either use the dark mode theme or light mode theme according to their preference.
